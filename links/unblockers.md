# CK Express Forecast

Our forecast is that CK-Express will soon visit this page and block all these websites. [ and by there domain ]
Soon we will use a website for this exact reason.

The website will be: webstar.live

# My Favorites

My favorite web proxy is Intrese & Interstellar for there sleek design & uv proxy with blazing fast speeds.

In my opinion, Interstellar is the best in my opinion for the games & more.
I recommend Intrese as it is a private proxy & is super fast too. Games will be added in the future!

# Proxys Information

[ The first one is known to be working because it is generated with random numbers making it basically impossible for filters to find it fast. ]

These proxys will be updated within a day or two if they are blocked in my school. 

Thank you! Webstar Development Team
