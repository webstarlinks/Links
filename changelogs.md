# Information About Changelogs

Changelogs will reset every week.
 
 # Nov 12.

Added New Links Since Some Were Blocked

# Nov 13.

Added One More Interstellar Link, Intrese Link & A Doge Unblocker Link. All proxys made by us have random strings so our blockers for school take forever to find it. 

<p>Added Incognito Proxy Links and will add more proxy links soon.</p>

# Nov 16.

Added maybe working links. (From Public Dumps & they may not work.) We recommend the links in links/unblockers.md because they are checked to make sure they are good with CK-Express.

Added TGB95 Links in the maybe working links: /links/maybe/tgb95/maybe.txt for more information
