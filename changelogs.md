# Information About Changelogs

Changelogs will reset every week.
 
 # Nov 12.

Added New Links Since Some Were Blocked

# Nov 13.

Added One More Interstellar Link, Intrese Link & A Doge Unblocker Link. All proxys made by us have random strings so our blockers for school take forever to find it. 

<p>Added Incognito Proxy Links and will add more proxy links soon.</p>

# Nov 16.

Added maybe working links. (From Public Dumps & they may not work.) We recommend the links in links/unblockers.md because they are checked to make sure they are good with CK-Express.

<p>Added TGB95 Links in the maybe working links: /links/maybe/tgb95/maybe.txt for more information</p>

<p>Added one Incognito Link with more domains hosting soon.</p>

<p>Added More Game Websites in links/maybe/games/maybe.txt: Added 100  Game Websites on Nov. 16 / Dump Games so 5% Chance of Working with CK Express</p>

# 8.00 PM PST Nov. 16

<p>Added one more Interstellar Link & working on Doge Unblocker Links, Doge Unblocker will be updated tomorrow.</p>

<p>We may cancel Metallic as it is no longer being worked on.</p>

# Dec. 4 

Added More Interstellar & added Shuttle Proxy Links

Sorry for being gone for 3 weeks, I had stuff to do!

# Dec. 6

Added more Incognito links and Metallic links.

We will add back Doge Unblocker & Art Class once I find more. ( The private ones made by us got taken down due to payment issues ]
